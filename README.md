# ðŸ“Š 911 Call Data Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project involves analyzing 911 call data from Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, using Python. The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mchirico/montcoalert) and contains various details about emergency calls, including location, time, and type of emergency.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **Pandas** â€“ For data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** â€“ For numerical computing and handling arrays
- **Seaborn (sns)** â€“ For advanced data visualization
- **Matplotlib** â€“ For plotting and graphical representation

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Information
The dataset includes the following columns:
- **lat** â€“ Latitude of the call
- **lng** â€“ Longitude of the call
- **desc** â€“ Description of the emergency
- **zip** â€“ Zip code where the call originated
- **title** â€“ Category of the emergency
- **timeStamp** â€“ Date and time of the call
- **twp** â€“ Township where the call occurred
- **addr** â€“ Address of the call
- **e** â€“ Emergency flag

## ðŸ“Š Features of the Analysis
- Exploring the most common reasons for 911 calls
- Analyzing call volume trends over time
- Visualizing geographical distribution of emergency calls
- Identifying patterns in response times and locations


## ðŸ”® Future Enhancements
- Adding interactive visualizations using Plotly
- Developing a machine learning model for call volume predictions
- Integrating GIS tools for spatial analysis
